# Development and Release Workflow

## Environments

### Live

* Production environment
* Deployed from `release/live` branch with tags

### Pre-release

* Regression test environment
* Deployed from `prerelease` branch

### Stage

* Testing environment
* Configuration same as live environment
* Connect to Stage Global Login service
* Deployed from `trunk` branch

### Sandbox

* Playground for developers
* Deployed from `develop` branch
* Connect to Stage Global Login service
* Global login for CORE disable (so that we donâ€™t need to do MFA)

## Branches

### release/live branch

* Used to track the latest released code

### prerelease branch

* Used for regression test
* Only merge new code to this branch right before a regression test

### golive branch

* Temporary branch, used for each hotfix/normal release
* A few golive branches may exist at the same time. e.g. `golive/2.2.1.4` `golive/2.2.1.5` `golive/2.2.2`
* Deleted after release
* Naming convention `golive/{version}`
  * `golive/1.3.5`

### trunk

* Used for normal testing
* Pull Request require checks(SonarClould, code review)

### develop

* Playground for developer
* Do not require pull request checks. Developer can push code to `develop` branch whenever needed, including debug codes

### feature/bugfix/hotfix branch

* Temporary branch, used for development
* Auto deleted after pull request get merged
* Naming convention `{prefix}/{JIRA story code}/{JIRA story title}`
  * `feature/CORE-1234/Example-feature-core-story`
  * `bugfix/AV2-123/Example-bugfix-app-story`
  * `hotfix/CUT-123/Example-hotfix-cutie-story`

## Development workflow

* Feature/bugfix development
  * Branch out from the `golive/*` branch
  * Once development finished, merge to `trunk` branch for testing
  * Once testing passed, merge to `golive/*` branch
* Hotfix development
  * Create `golive/*` branch for this hotfix (branch out from `release/live`)
  * Create hotfix branch (branch out from the `golive/*` branch for this hotfix)
  * Once development finished, merge to `trunk` branch for testing
  * Once testing passed, merge to the `golive/*` branch for this hotfix

## Release workflow

Once all tickets in one release have passed tests and marked as done. It's the time to start the release workflow

1. Define Regression and PVT scope - Risk Assess areas
2. Merge `golive/*` branch to `prerelease` branch so that it will deploy to the `pre-release` environment
3. QA start regression test on `pre-release` environment
   1. Hotfix on `golive/*` branch if defects found
4. Merge `prerelease` to `release/live` and create a new tag on `release/live` branch once regression test finished
5. Compare the new tag with the live tag to make sure the code changes in the new tag are correct to be released
6. Announce the scheduled release time in Slack release channel
7. Trigger the release
8. QA do PVT on live
9. Announce the release in Slack to broader team

### Release versioning

* We will use the same version across all repos for feature version change e.g. 2.2.1 to 2.2.2
* For each feature/hotfix release, we will always release `core`, `graphql`, `app` these 3 repos, even if there are no code changes in one of the repos
* When we do a feature release e.g. 2.2.1 to 2.2.2, releaes all repos (including chat-api, login-api, login-app, statistics, template-lib-api, messaging-service, webhooks, etc.) even if there are no code changes in any of the repos

Example 1:

* We are doing a feature release 2.2.1 to 2.2.2
* We will create tag version 2.2.2 to all repos
* We will release all repos
* Every repo is at 2.2.2

Example 2:

* We are doing a hotfix release 2.2.1.4 to 2.2.1.5
* We will create tag version 2.2.1.5 only to `core`, `graphql`, `app`, or if there are code changes for any of the other repo, also create tage verion 2.2.1.5 to it
* We will only release `core`, `graphql`, `app` these 3 repos if there are no code changes for other repos
* `core`, `graphql`, `app` are at 2.2.1.5
* Other repos stays at the feature version 2.2.1
