# Set up code reviewer notifier

This documentation tells about how to set up the Github Code Reviewer Notifier for Slack.

## Set up Code Review Notifier webhook for repo

* This is used for the admin of a GitHub repository to add a webhook for the repo, so that other people can be notified when a review assigned

* *Note: only the admin of the repo needs to set up this. Other people just need to enable the Code Review Notifier for yourself.*

1. Go to the "Settings" of the GitHub repository
1. Go to the "Webhooks" on the left side bar
1. Click "Add webhook"
1. Put `https://github-code-review-notifier.now.sh/github?workspace=T02TCHV4Y` as the "Payload URL"
1. In "**Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?**" part, select "Let me select individual events.", and only select "Pull requests" and "Pull request reviews"
1. Click "Add webhook"

## Enable Code Review Notifier for yourself

1. In Slack, send a direct message to Code Review Notifier. (e.g. "hi")
1. Code Review Notifier will give you options to config
