## Priority

* **Critical** - this is a showstopper in LIVE code. It is not for unreleased features. At any given time, there should be no or very few critical bugs.
* **Blocker** - we cannot release the associated feature until this issue is resolved. When we’re a few weeks away from a release there may be several “blockers” for the next feature. As we get close to release this should drop to 0.
* **Medium** - these are bugs/issues we’ve decided should be addressed; to be done as soon as practical. We should try to keep this down to under 30.
* **Low** - these are issues that we are tracking but which we will NOT work on unless they are re-prioritized. There will be MANY of these.
* **Not Prioritized** - the Product/eng team has not yet reviewed these issues. There should be a few of these each week, but then they should be moved into one of the above categories. This should not have a lot in it.
