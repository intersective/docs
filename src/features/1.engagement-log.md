# Engagement log

Engagement log is a feature to track user's engagement in an experience. Finally the data can be exported as a report.

## Tasks

1. Create a new db with a table `engagement_logs` with `id, user_id, timeline_id, date`
2. Create a new event in `statistics` lambda function
   * It checks if the last engagement log of this user is within 1 hour, if so, ignore the event
   * It writes the log to the new db table
   * It marks this user as `engaged`
3. CORE/GraphQL will invoke this new lambda function event after decoding jwt
4. Create a new column in enrolment table `engagement_status`. Valid values are `uninvited, invited, engaged, disengaged, dropped, deleted`
   * Add the logic to write the status accordingly in CORE
5. On institution/experience setting page, admin can set the engagement period (user is defined as "engaged" if the last log is within X days)
6. Write a cronjob in the new lambda function to run every day
   * This cronjob only checks live experiences
   * Checks every 'engaged' user in an experience, if the user is not engaged anymore, change the status to `disengaged`

## Engagement status

* uninvited
  * User is enrolled but haven't send invite email
* invited
  * Invitation email has sent to the user but user do not have any engagement log
* engaged
  * User have engagement log within X days (configured in experience/institution)
* disengaged
  * User doesn't have engagement log within X days (configured in experience/institution)
* dropped
  * Admin mark the user as dropped
* deleted
  * Admin mark the user as deleted

## Questions

1. Are there any logic to apply for "dropped" user?
   1. Dropped user won't be able to access the experience anymore
   2. Dropped user won't be calculated for engagement/disengagement
2. Where do we export the report? What should the report look like?
